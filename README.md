# scripts_MD_NR

These are the scripts used to process MD the simulations into number density distributions, and then 
to calculate the reflectivity over a range of contrasts. 

Reflectivity codes require the RAT toolbox: https://github.com/RascalSoftware/RAT

MD codes require MD2REFLECT (https://gitlab.com/alberginia/Made2Reflect)
